Twitter is an online social media and social networking service owned and operated by American company X Corp., the successor of Twitter, Inc. Twitter users outside the United States are legally served by the Ireland-based Twitter International Unlimited Company, which makes these users subject to Irish and European Union data protection laws.
On Twitter, users post texts, images and videos known as "tweets".[13][14] Registered users can tweet, like, "retweet" tweets, and direct message (DM) other registered users. Users interact with Twitter through browser or mobile frontend software, or programmatically via its application programming interfaces (APIs).
You can use the data you can get from social media in a number of ways, like sentiment analysis (analyzing people's thoughts) on a specific issue or field of interest.
There are several ways you can scrape (or gather) data from Twitter. 
We will learn a method to scrape public conversations from people on a specific trending topic, as well as tweets from a particular user.
Snscrape is an approach for scraping information from Twitter that does not require the use of an API. Snscrape allows you to scrape basic information such as a user's profile, tweet content, source, and so on.
Snscrape is not limited to Twitter, but can also scrape content from other prominent social media networks like Facebook, Instagram, and others.
Its advantages are that there are no limits to the number of tweets you can retrieve or the window of tweets (that is, the date range of tweets). So Snscrape allows you to retrieve old data.
